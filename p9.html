You've probably been pumping through the bodyweight staple since elementary school, so it's easy to think you know just about everything about the exercise. The movement is pretty simple, after all what you're doing is literally in the name. </p> <p> But there's more nuance to the move than just hitting the ground and pushing off. Your body position is essential to get the most out of the pushup ( learn more about that here) . Your ultimate aim when doing the exercise is just as important, according to trainer Charlee Atkins, C.S.C.S. </p> <p> "Let's talk about the goal of a pushup," she says. "The perfect pushup isn't doing the most reps. A perfect pushup is lowering all the way down and then extending all the way back up to the starting position."</p> <p> Atkins notices that a certain type of person she works with commonly skips out on that form and care for speed and brute strength. Dudes, she's talking about us. </p> This content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site. <p> "Most of my male clients forget the extension at the top and are instead worried about how many they can do," Atkins says. The trainer suggests that guys who are trying to get more out of their pushups should instead try to vary the intensity of your workouts by adding elements of instability and movement. </p> <p> This four-move series gives you an opportunity to do just that, with three challenging pushup variations and one regression.</p> This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site. View On Instagram <p> Perform each variation for 10 reps </p> Hands Elevated Pushup - <p> Place your hands on a weight bench or some other platform (a couch or ottoman works just as well if you're training at home) to get into an elevated plank position. This is a better regression for the standard pushup than getting on your knees, since you'll still need to keep your glutes engaged to keep your posture solid. Perform reps in the elevated position until you can perform 10 or more without much effort. </p> Iso Pushup Hold <p> This variation challenges your chest, shoulders, core and glutes even more with an isometric hold at the bottom of each rep. Start by holding for 2 seconds, then work your way up to longer pauses. If you struggle to press back up to the top position, don't stress just take a page from Atkins and lower your knees to the ground to make it easier until you build enough strength to do so without the help. </p> Lateral Walk and Pushup <p> Get moving in the frontal plane by adding lateral hand walks to your pushups. Cross one hand over the other, perform a pushup rep, then reverse the movement. Most importantly, keep your posture solid as you move by engaging core and glutes the whole time. </p> Pushup and Shoulder Tap <p> This classic variation helps to build stability and challenge your unilateral strength and balance. Once you're in a solid plank position, lift one hand off the ground, tap your opposite shoulder, and repeat. Try to keep your shoulders level as you switch between plant arms. </p> <p> You can insert these variations into your workouts in place of standard pushups, or you can take them on as a series, performing 3 to 4 rounds through the whole set. If you're ready for even more pushup challenges, check out this at-home, pushup-only routine. </p> <p> Want to learn more moves from Atkins?
