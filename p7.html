My high school cheerleading coach insisted that the whole squad could bang out 20 push-ups by the time summer cheer camp ended and football season began. I was 15, and the heaviest thing I lifted regularly was a large iced coffee from Dunkin’. I tried as hard as I could, but always dropped to my knees after five.</p> <p> Now, as a fitness editor, I know that if that drill sergeant coach had offered us proper modifications and helped us work up to a full push-up, I may have actually been able to do them. Luckily, I now know the truth: There are so many different ways to do a push-up, and there are plenty of easier places to start if your upper-body strength just isn’t there yet.</p> <p> The key to fitness is modification, whether that modification is used to facilitate an exercise or to make it harder,” Jackie Stalzer , a trainer at New York Sports Club in Queens, New York, tells SELF. “Knowing when and how to challenge yourself can help you reach your fitness goals faster. Knowing your body, paying attention to form, and being aware of why you&#x27;re actually performing an exercise will make your efforts worthwhile. </p> <p> When it comes to push-ups, Stalzer says that typically performing them on an incline, or in any other way that shortens your range of motion (a.k.a., how much you need to bend your elbows to reach the bottom of the movement), makes them easier. Adding components that challenge stability, work other muscle groups, or have your arms in a declined position makes the movement more challenging.</p> <p> Even if you’ve mastered the basic push-up, it’s worth incorporating other types into your routine, she says. “Not only is it a good idea to perform multiple types of push-ups to engage different parts of your body, but it&#x27;s also important to explore your options to find out which variations work best for you. Some will work your biceps or triceps more, while others ask more of your core, shoulders, or chest.</p> <p> Here, Stalzer demos 16 different push-up variations you can try, starting (roughly) from easiest to hardest, though the true difficulty ranking will vary a bit depending on the person. As for me, I can now do at least 20 full push-ups with good form—something my teenage self would have never thought possible—after incorporating more strength training into my routine and, yes, starting with modified movements and working my way up to a standard push-up.</p> <p> If that’s a goal of yours, or if you are simply looking for new ways to work your arms, shoulders, back, and chest, try the moves below.</p> <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 1</span> <h2> <span> Modified Push-Up on Yoga Block</span> </h2> <p> Stalzer says she prefers not to have clients do push-ups with their knees directly on the floor. I like the surface to be elevated, so you&#x27;re kneeling but are 6 to 10 inches off the ground. This way it’s a little more similar to the form of a proper push-up, so when we eventually transition from knees to toes it’s a lot easier. </p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Place a yoga block or similar surface for elevation under your knees. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower your body as close to the floor as you can. Push back up to start. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 2</span> <h2> <span> Modified Push-Ups With Yoga Blocks Under Chest</span> </h2> <p> This is a great place for beginners to start because it allows you to work within the range of motion that you can handle at an angle that&#x27;s more similar to a standard push-up (as opposed to a traditional modified push-up where your knees are on the floor, Stalzer says. As you progress, take away a yoga block.</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Place yoga blocks (anywhere from three to one), or books if you don&#x27;t have blocks, under your chest. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower your chest to the blocks. Push back up to start. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 3</span> <h2> <span> Incline Push-Ups</span> </h2> <p> Doing push-ups on an incline changes the strain that the gravity force vector places on your body, Stalzer says. In other words, changing the angle so that you&#x27;re higher than the ground makes it easier for you to perform the movement.</p> Grab a bench or chair and place it in front of your body. Place your hands on the chair and walk your feet back until you are at about a 45-degree angle to the chair. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself as close to the chair as you can. Push back up to start. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 4</span> <h2> <span> Standard Push-Ups</span> </h2> <p> A standard push-up works your shoulders, chest, triceps, biceps, back, core, quads, and glutes. Think of it as a moving plank—you&#x27;ll want to keep everything tight as you bend your arms. Keep your neck neutral and aligned with your spine (chin tucked), Stalzer says.</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself as close to the floor as you can. Your elbows should be at about a 45-degree angle to your torso. Push back up to start. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 5</span> <h2> <span> Wide-Grip Push-Ups</span> </h2> <p> This is performed similar to a standard push-up, just with your hands positioned slightly wider than normal. This places more force on the anterior deltoids and pectoralis minor, Stalzer says. (Those are the muscles in the upper part of your chest, close to your shoulders.)</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor a little bit wider than shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself as close to the floor as you can. Push back up to start. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 6</span> <h2> <span> Push-Ups With Feet on Foam Roller</span> </h2> <p> The foam roller incorporates instability because it removes your grounding, Stalzer says. You have to really engage your core, butt, and more, to keep your body from toppling over in this position.</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Place your toes on a foam roller. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself as close to the floor as you can. Push back up to start. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 7</span> <h2> <span> Push-Ups With Hands on Foam Rollers</span> </h2> <p> This push-up incorporates an aspect of instability for the upper body, targeting the shoulder stabilizers, Stalzer notes.</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart. Place each hand on top of a foam roller. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself as close to the floor as you can. Push back up to start. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 8</span> <h2> <span> One-Legged Push-Ups</span> </h2> <p> Doing push-ups with one leg works the quads more on the leg that is on the floor and works the glutes of the leg that is in the air, Stalzer says. The higher you lift your leg, the tighter your glutes will contract—just make sure you don&#x27;t extend so far that you start to arch your lower back, she warns.</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Lift one leg off the ground. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself as close to the floor as you can. Push back up to start. Keep the lifted leg off the ground the entire time. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 9</span> <h2> <span> Spiderman Push-Ups</span> </h2> <p> Bringing your knee up to your elbow adds hip flexor and oblique contractions, depending on the angle that you can handle. The farther out to the side that your leg is from your body, the more you engage your obliques, Stalzer says.</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself as close to the floor as you can. As you lower your body, bend one leg out to the side and bring your knee toward the same-side arm. Push back up to start, and straighten your leg back out. Repeat alternating sides. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 10</span> <h2> <span> Eccentric Push-Ups</span> </h2> <p> An eccentric push-up is done by slowly lowering oneself down to the floor and quickly pressing back up, Stalzer says. Why would you want to do that? Research shows that focusing on the eccentric (lowering) portion of a movement can lead to bigger gains in both strength and muscle size.</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself the floor very slowly. It should take about three counts to get there. Push back up to start. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 11</span> <h2> <span> Push-Ups With Towel Under Toes</span> </h2> <p> Placing a towel under your toes challenges your core by eliminating the force that you can exert on the floor through your toes. Lacking this grounding, you must keep your core elevated and engaged, your back straight, and your shoulders directly above your hands, Stalzer says. Otherwise, your feet will start to slide.</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Place one (or both) feet on a towel. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself as close to the floor as you can. Push back up to start. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 12</span> <h2> <span> Decline Push-Ups</span> </h2> <p> Inversely to an incline push-up, a decline push-up changes the angle by elevating your feet off the ground, increasing intensity, Stalzer says.</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Rest your feet on a chair or other elevated surface—the higher the elevation, the harder this will be. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself as close to the floor as you can. Push back up to start. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 13</span> <h2> <span> Hand-Release Push-Ups</span> </h2> <p> Hand-release push-ups force you to generate momentum from the hardest point of the movement, Stalzer says. They also add some sneaky back work into the push-up. It&#x27;s important to keep your core tight and back flat as you push back up—it&#x27;s easy to strain your lower back in this movement if you&#x27;re not staying stiff as a board.</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself down to the floor. Keeping your elbows bent and close to your body, lift your palms off the floor and squeeze your shoulder blades. Place your hands back down on the ground and push back up to start. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 14</span> <h2> <span> Triceps/Military-Style Push-Ups</span> </h2> <p> A military push-up is performed similar to that of a standard push-up. The main difference is that you have to keep your arms close to your body throughout the range of motion. This puts more of an emphasis on your triceps, and even your lats if you&#x27;re maintaining proper form, Stalzer says.</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Turn your elbows so that they are facing behind you. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself as close to the floor as you can. Keep your arms close to your torso as you perform the movement. Push back up to start. <p> Even if you&#x27;ve mastered a standard push-up, you may still have a tough time with a triceps push-up. If you can&#x27;t keep your body in a straight line as you push back up, do this one on your knees instead.</p> <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 15</span> <h2> <span> Diamond Push-Ups</span> </h2> <p> This variation really challenges your triceps. The closer your hands are to the midline of your body, the more your triceps have to compensate for the lack of force produced by your chest and shoulders, Stalzer says.</p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Walk your hands in under your chest so that your thumbs and forefingers on each hand are close together and form a diamond. Keeping your body in one long line and your elbows close to your sides, bend your arms and lower yourself as close to the floor as you can. Push back up to start. <span> </span> Amber Venerable <span> 16</span> <h2> <span> Clap Push-Ups</span> </h2> <p> The clapping push-up incorporates an explosive motion and a deceleration motion. You must generate enough force to lift yourself off the ground to give yourself enough time to clap your hands together and then return to your start position, Stalzer explains. It&#x27;s definitely an advanced move to work up to. </p> Start in a high plank position with your hands flat on the floor about shoulder-width apart, wrists under shoulders. Keeping your body in one long line, bend your arms and lower yourself as close to the floor as you can. Use as much power as you can in your arms to push back up and lift your body high enough off the ground that you can then clap your hands together under your chest. Quickly put your hands back on the ground to land, and lower immediately into another rep. <p> Trainer Jackie Stalzer is wearing Lululemon Mind Over Miles Crop Top (similar styles at lululemon.com ), Lululemon Pace Perfect Bra ($58, lululemon.com ), Lululemon Sun Setter 7/8 Tight (similar styles at lululemon.com ), and APL Women&#x27;s TechLoom Pro sneakers ($140, athleticpropulsionlabs.com ). </p> <span> </span> Amy is a freelance writer who covers health, fitness, outdoors, and travel.
